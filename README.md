# Framework for Brain Data Processing, Multimodality Synchronization, and Feature Experimentation
### Done by Martin Picek at .NeuroRestore (EPFL, Lausanne)
#### Supervised by Prof. Henri Lorach and Icare Sakr (project based on his work)
**This code is only a part of a larger project developing a Multimodal Self-Supervised Transformer-Based AutoEncoder Model for Brain Feature Extraction. The model has a separate private repository available upon request.**

This repository contains brain, latent image feature, and kinematics data extraction, synchronization, and preprocessing. Furthermore, additional experiments are performed.
