# Dataset for the Kinematics-Guided Self-Supervised Transformer-Based AutoEncoder for Brain Feature Extraction
### Done by Martin Picek at .NeuroRestore (EPFL, Lausanne)
#### Supervised by Prof. Henri Lorach and Icare Sakr (project based on his work)

This repository contains only the brain and kinematics data extraction, synchronization, and preprocessing. The source code for the Kinematics-Guided Self-Supervised Transformer-Based AutoEncoder is in a separate (private) repository.
